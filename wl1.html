    <h2>
      <strong>Be single
      </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>It is actually very easy to be single. Fist start to not leave the house or communicate with other humans. This is maybe the safes way to protect yourself from a relationship. The longer you stick to this strategie the easier it gets, because you forget how to interact with people.

    <h2>Own at least 5 cats
    </h2>
    <p>The easiest way to own a bunch of cats is to go in differen animal centers and offer them to adopt two cats. Tell them you just take them at least in couples because it is crule to keep them alone. Make sure to present yourself as the perfect new mummy of the kitten.

    <h2>
      <strong>Look desperated
      </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>There are a few basic steps to follow if you want to look desperate. First of all wear jogging pants and hoodie all day. It is also suggested to wash your hair rarely and do not do any makeup. Brushing your teeth and taking showers is accepted as cats also do not like smelly humans.
